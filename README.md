# Antony Mwandiki - Portfolio Website
Welcome to my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my web development journey and the skills I've honed in front-end development. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project represents my dedication to creating responsive and interactive websites.

## About This Portfolio
This project is part of my participation in the S-Hook Hackathon 1: Portfolio Challenge presented by Safaricom. The challenge required participants to build a personal portfolio website to showcase their skills, projects, and professional background using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As a developer, this portfolio serves as a personal reflection of my growth and the skills I have gained throughout the hackathon, highlighting my proficiency in front-end development and my ability to build responsive, user-friendly websites.

## The website features the following sections:

1. About Me: An introduction to who I am and my passion for web development.
2. Education and Experience: A rundown of the technologies I use and the skills I’ve developed.
3. Projects: A showcase of web development projects that demonstrate my abilities.
4. Interests: A showcase of my tech proffessional interests.
5. Contact: A contact form for potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in reaching out.

## Technologies Used
### This portfolio is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5: Used to structure the content of the website, including sections like About, Experience, Projects, and Contact.
- CSS3: For styling the website, including layout, typography, colors, and responsive design to ensure the website works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Flexbox and Grid Layout: Utilized for creating a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- Media Queries: Ensures the website is fully responsive and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- JavaScript: Used to add interactivity to the website, including:
- Form Validation: Ensures that the user inputs valid data before submission.
- Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on any device from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- Interactive Contact Form: Built with HTML and JavaScript, the contact form validates user input before submission, ensuring that only complete messages are sent.
- Project Showcase: The portfolio features interactive project tiles that reveal more details when clicked, providing a clean and engaging way to present my work.
- Smooth Animations: I’ve implemented smooth animations for when users scroll through different sections, making the navigation experience more engaging.

## Future Enhancements
1. Add JavaScript Frameworks: I plan to integrate React for more dynamic interactivity and efficiency in managing components.

3. Advanced Animations: I plan to add more advanced animations using CSS and JavaScript to make the portfolio even more visually stunning.
